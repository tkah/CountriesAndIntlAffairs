Project Name: Countries and International Affairs
1.Description
Our project will show the Countries and some relevant 
International Affairs. This includes 4 entities sets and 6 relationships.
===== Entities ======
1)Countries(countryCode, name, population, unStats, whoStats, wbStats)
This describe some basic information about a country. Although
a country's name is unqiue, we also used a standard countryCode
as the key. It is good to use a fixed length countryCode to represent
a country than to use various length country names if we want to organize
the data more beautifully. Some countires have really long names.  
2)Leaders(name, term, gender)

This entity set stores the Leaders' information. There is very few
case that leaders had same name. Commonly, leaders ran several
terms.  To indicate some international affairs, we need to indicate
the time and term of a certain leader.

3)Conflicts(name, dateStart, dateEnd, descriptiono)
This records the conflicts between two or more countries. We consider the 
dateStart, dateEnd and description are all determined by a given conflict name.

4)Treaties(name, description) is in some sense the reverse kind of conflict.
They are often good affairs between two or more contries. Similarly,
we consider that the description can be determined by the treaties' name.

===== Relationships =====
1)The leaderOf relationship from Leaders to Countries is many-one. A leader
must lead one country. While a country has many leaders at different time.
2)The borders is from Countries to Countries because often a country has
many neighbors. This is a many-many realtionship.
3)The tradesWith is also a many-many relationship. We added a totalTrade 
attribute to this relationship.
4)The migration is also a many-many relationship. We added immigrants and 
emmigrants attibutes to it.
5)The conflictParty is a many-many relationship. A country may involved in
many conflicts in history. A conflict may include many countries as well.
6)The relationship treatySignee is really like conflictParty just like the
entity Treaties is like Conflicts. The treatySignee is a many-many 
relationship.
